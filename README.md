Developing a Decision Tree for a problem to identify the best decision to make using PrecisionTree tool

alDev Associates, Inc., a property development firm, purchased in 2012 a large old house near a town 
square in Concord. The old house was built in the late-1960s and the CalDev Associates restored it. 
For more than a decade, the company has leased the house to the nearby college for academic office 
space. The house is located on a wide lawn and has become a town landmark.  
However, in 2022 the lease with the college was expiring, and CalDev Associates decided to build a 
hotel that would use all of the open space. The community was outraged and complained to the city 
council. One of the city’s supervisors spoke with a representative from CalDev and hinted that if the 
company requested a permit, there was a fairly high chance that it would be rejected.  
The top management at CalDev Associates had a series of meetings to review their alternatives. 
Eventually, they came up with three options: sell the property, request a permit to build a five-star 
hotel; or request a permit for an office building which would be, according to the city’s supervisor, 
more appropriate for the city.  
The management estimated that they could sell the property for $2.1 million. They also came to a 
conclusion that the hotel permit had a chance of 0.25 for being approved. If this happened and the 
city’s economic growth would continue (according to the city council estimate, the chance is 0.6), the 
company would earn $3.4 million.  In case of the declined economic activity (the chance is 0.4), CalDev 
would earn only $1.6 million. If the hotel permit is rejected (a chance is 0.75), the company could sell 
the property again for the same amount of money ($2.1 million), or lease it back to the college for 
$2.4 million, or request a new permit for the office building. If this permit is approved (the chance 
was estimated to be 0.7), CalDev could earn $2.9 million assuming the economic growth in the city, 
and $1.3 million in case of economic decline. If the permit for the office building is rejected (a chance 
is 0.3), CalDev could sell the property for $2.1 million or lease to the college for $2.4 million. 
CalDev Associates could request the permit for the office building from the start with the same 
consequences (probabilities and earnings) as those described above. The office building permit may 
be approved with the subsequent possible economic growth or decline in the city, or rejected with 
the subsequent selling or leasing of the property.  
Each permit for building the hotel or for the office building would cost CalDev $300,000 for 
architectural design, drawings, submission fees, etc.
