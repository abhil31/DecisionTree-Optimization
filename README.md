Developing a Decision Tree for a problem to identify the best decision to make using PrecisionTree tool

In 2012, CalDev Associates, Inc., a property development firm, acquired an old house in Concord, built in the late 1960s, near the town square. They restored it and leased it to a nearby college for academic offices. By 2022, the lease was ending, prompting CalDev to consider building a hotel on the land. However, the community opposed this, prompting discussions with city officials. The management explored three options: selling the property for $2.1 million, seeking a permit for a five-star hotel (with a 0.25 chance of approval), or applying for an office building permit (with a 0.7 chance of approval). Each permit application would cost $300,000. Depending on economic growth or decline (estimated at 0.6 and 0.4 respectively), the potential earnings ranged from $1.3 million to $3.4 million. If permits were rejected, they could sell the property or lease it back to the college. Ultimately, they faced a decision between pursuing a hotel, office building, or simply selling the property, considering various probabilities and financial outcomes.
